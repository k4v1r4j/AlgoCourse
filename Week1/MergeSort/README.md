###Problem Statement:
Sort the given array in ascending order. Such that for all i<j, A[i] < A[j]

###Motivation:
Sorting is one of the most fundamental problem in computer science. Merge sort is 
better than naive sorting technique like insertion, selection or bubble sort.

### Naive Solution (brute force): `Run time: O(n^2)`


### Better Solution (Merge Sort): `Run time: O(nlogn)`

Uses divide and conquer 

###Benchmark:
