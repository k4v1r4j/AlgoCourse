###Problem Statement:
To find the closest pair of points in the collection of given points (say P). The distance between two points is a simple
[euclidiean distance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance).

###Motivation:
This problem has application in traffic-control systems. A system for controlling sea or air traffic might need to identify the two closest vehicles in order to detect potential collisions.

### Naive Solution (brute force): `Run time: O(n^2)`


### Better Solution (Quick Sort): `Run time: O(nlogn)

Uses divide and conquer approach.
