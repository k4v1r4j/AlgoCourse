###Problem Statement:
Sort the given array(say A) in an increasing order. Such that for all i<j, A[i] < A[j]

###Motivation:
Sorting is one of the most fundamental problem in computer science. 

### Naive Solution (brute force): `Run time: O(n^2)`


### Better Solution (Quick Sort): `Run time: O(nlogn) "on Average"`

Uses divide and conquer approach. Partioning of an array based on the pivot element is the key idea here.
