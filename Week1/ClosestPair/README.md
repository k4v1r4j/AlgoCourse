###Problem Statement:
To find the closest pair of points in the collection of given points (say P). The distance between two points is a simple
(euclidiean distance)[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance].

###Motivation:
Sorting is one of the most fundamental problem in computer science. 

### Naive Solution (brute force): `Run time: O(n^2)`


### Better Solution (Quick Sort): `Run time: O(nlogn) "on Average"`

Uses divide and conquer approach. Partioning of an array based on the pivot element is the key idea here.
