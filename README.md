This repo contains implementation of programs that are taught in [Stanford Algorithm Course](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo).It is only for learning and education purpose.Contributions to bug fix or enhancement are welcome.

###README.md Contents
Every problem in this repo have README.md that will help in understanding solution to the problem with following sections.
<pre>
* Problem statement - Defines the problem
* Motivation        - Why you need to solve the problem after all?
* Naive solution    - Solving the problem using naive approach usually by brute force
* Better solution   - Solving the problem using algorithimic approach
* Benchmark         - How come one solution is better than another?
</pre>
###Files

Every problem have following files
<pre>
