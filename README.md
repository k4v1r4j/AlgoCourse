This repo contains implementation of programs that are taught in [Stanford Algorithm Course](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo).It is only for learning and education purpose.Contributions are welcome.


Each and every problem in this repo has README.md that will help in understanding solution to the problem with following sections.

* Problem statement - Defines the problem
* Motivation - Why you need to solve the problem after all?
* Naive solution - Solving the problem using naive approach usually by brute force
* Better solution - Solving the problem using algorithimic approach( like Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming etc..)
* Benchmark - There is no reason for you to belive me that one solution is better than another right?. This section presents you a demo by running two solution and calculating benchmark.
